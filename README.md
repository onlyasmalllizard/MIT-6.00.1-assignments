This repository is for assignments I completed on the MIT 6.00.1 course on EDX.

Guess My Number
-----
This program asks the user to think of a number between 0 and 100 and makes guesses by asking whether the number is too high or too low. The computer will store the latest guess as the high or low point, respectively, and guess halfway between those points until the user tells it the guess is correct.
